Computer Science Bsc Project

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a complete and functional application that allows an end user to easily reserve, book and pay for a parking slot. There is a strong emphasis on user experience as well as ease-of-use. Another area of focus is simultaneous access of the system, where more than one user is trying to initiate a booking at the same time.
